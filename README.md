# project  create a mytoken 


First in all open remix application for compile code solidity ethereum blockchain.

This is a basic token contract written in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. It includes the following features:

Public Variables:
tokenName: The name of the token.
tokenAbbrev: The abbreviation of the token.
totalSupply: The total supply of the token.


Mapping:
balances: A mapping of addresses to their corresponding token balances and adreess greater than unit256.

Functions:

mint:
write the function mint and place the address and unit256 values.
then, 
Increases the total supply of the token by the specified amount.
Increases the balance of the specified address by the specified amount.

burn:
write the function burn and place the address and unit256 values.
Decreases the total supply of the token by the specified amount.
Decreases the balance of the specified address by the specified amount.
Ensures that the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the amount to be burned.

compile the code solidity compiler pragma solidity 0.8.18 

then goto deploy&run transaction and deploy the code.









## Deployment

To use this contract, you can deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain and then use the mint and burn functions to manage the token supply and balances.
